# Running DAS tools on linux

DAS is only available for windows - unless you simulate a windows environment
in a docker container, provide a patched version of the FTD2XX library and let
it communicate with an FTDI server on your host over OS pipes.

**Use on your own risk** - we recommend you get familiar with the windows setup first
before you enter this flimsy, undocumented region of prototyping.

# I am brave, let me!
You conciously or accidentaly decided to keep going, so how to get started?
Note: This setup is most likely not ideal, but the first working result after a 
long path of failed attempts. This setup has a lot of potential to be improved

## Prepare for building the artifacts
You need to build two artifacts for windows, specifically for the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
target. This trivially cannot be done on linux, the desired option would be to 
use the `cross` project but I was unable to get it running. You thus want to build
a docker container using the `xwin` project that allows you to build rust applications with
the given target.

```bash
docker build .. -f xwin.Dockerfile --tag veecle/xwin
```

Note that this uses the parenting folder as the build context to prime the cargo
registry caches inside the container.

## Build artifacts for the simulated windows environment
You need to build two artifacts for the simulated windows environment. The commands
are already prepared in `build_artifacts.sh`

## Build the simulated windows environment
This folder should now contain a folder `artifacts` with two files: `ftd2xx.dll`
and `win-daemon.exe`. You can now build the virtual environment with

```bash
docker build . --tag veecle/flash-tricore
```

## Install the correct version of tricore-probe
Install tricore-probe with default features disabled and the `docker` feature enabled
to use the docker container as a backend instead of the native windows implementation.

Ã‰t voila! If everything worked, tricore-probe now runs on your linux machine.
