# Infineon Multi-Core-Debug demo project

This folder contains the extracted demo taken from the [Infineon Device Access Server product page](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/das/#!?fileId=db3a30431ed1d7b2011f469ac40e56af). 
In the parenting library we specifically require the `mcd_api.h` header file that 
defines how to interface with the `mcdxdas.dll` library that is shipped with the
Device Access Server installation.

By the time downloaded the archive was called `mcd_demo_basic_120412.zip`, and the product page mentioned version 1.0, release date `May 30, 2012`.
